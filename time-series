# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± I recently qualified for JDLA Deep Learning for ENGINEERï¼ˆEè³‡æ ¼ï¼‰in March, 2022.

# About personal projects
## 1. Child Face Generation
- Named [p2p-editing](https://github.com/jiangjw88/p2p-editing), as my first repository on github.
- After reading "Development Deep Learning by PyTorch", I had an idea to try to generate child photos from parents photos.
- I read a lot of articles and papers and came to a conclusion that by merging the features of the parents' photos one can get a photo of them with their features at the same time.
